# Uing storytelling structure in daily life 

## Nancy Duarte's approach
- [Overview video here](https://www.ted.com/talks/nancy_duarte_the_secret_structure_of_great_talks), and [her interview on Lenny's podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/storytelling-with-nancy-duarte-how-to-craft-compelling/id1627920305?i=1000615287230).
- what is, what could be (what is, what could, what is, what could… sense of longing)… and then finally: new bliss at the end
- beginning, middle, end
- rise and fall (build tension and release it)
- create longing… tell future in shape of a story
- audience journey — big idea: where you moving them from, where you moving them to? what is your POV and what’s at stake if they do or don’t adopt it
- each slide should make 1 point in support of that big idea… don’t make an extra slide unless it support the big idea with a new point.
