---

I'm writing this guide for myself, and making it public so it might help others. I'm going to version it as I make changes. I'll cover holistically a wide range of topics.

### Nutrition

Hydration
- keep water bottle full, but don’t overdo it

Diet
- Mostly Paleo. Avoid gluten, avoid cow dairy.
    - Breakfast: oatmeal, eggs, bacon, chia pudding, berries
    - lunch: animal protein + veggies, raw or cooked.
    - dinner: animal protein + starchy veggies / rice / grain-free carb alts (eg. almond flour/casava pasta)

Mini-protocols twice a year, ~15-30 days
- for SIBO control + digestive health
- for me: strict grain/dairy-free + low FODMAP + no refined sugars (even if “paleo” treats with things like coconut sugar, agave, monk fruit, etc.)

Meal Hygiene
- Don't graze between meals. This keeps digestion "on" all the time, and it needs rest to go through it's processes well. At each meal, try to eat all your food within a 30m window, then stay fasted until the next meal. Snacking is ok, but sit and make it a real snack with fasting before/after, and only eating within a small window to avoid drawn out grazing.
- Don't eat within a few hours of sleeping. Metabolism keeps body awake and impacts sleep negatively.
- Chew very well — slowly, intentionally when possible. Gives enzymes in mouth chance to break down food more before stomach, leads to better digestion overall.
- Drink fluids before meal (not during or after) for optimal digestion. More fluids = more dilution of digestive juices

Fasting
- Default to 14:10, but shift to 16:8 (or more) when needed
- Currently no extended fasts or water fasts

Supplementation
- 1g/day, DHA Omega-3 (fish oil, omegagenics)
        - why? anti-inflammatory impact because of low 3:6 ratio assumption; anecdotally, joints and digestion (post-SIBO) feel much better/smoother when taking O3.
- Adaptogens (Reishi, Chaga, Cordyceps, Lions Mane)
- Caffeine (1 espresso worth per day; one or two more espresso drinks with decaf for the ritual)
- Resveratrol - paused.
- Homocysteine Supreme (aka B-complex) - paused.
- SIBO-related supps (eg. DGL powder for mucous membrane support) - paused.

Cooking
- Basic ingredients for basic meals.
    - Fruits (berries, bananas, oranges/mandarins, apples, stonefruit, kiwi, lemon/limes)
    - Veggies (onion/shallot, garlic, celery, carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms, leafy greens like spinach/arugula/kale/lettuce)
    - Starches (rices, gluten-free pastas, sometimes GF breads -- no buckweaht, no millet, no sourghum)
    - Meats (salmon/cod fillet or smoked; canned small fishes like anchovies/mackarel/sardines... Patagonia Provisions is tasty; pre-cooked chicken via [Kevin's](https://www.kevinsnaturalfoods.com/); ground beef 80/20 grassfed pasture; heritage pork bacon)
- Meal prep
    - Sunday after farmers market I try to chop/prep fruits and veggies. Put them in a clear jar (re-using from my meal delivery services) so it's easy to see in fridge and take out for cooking/snacking. 
- Prepared meal delivery: I use Methodology and Territory for meals weekly. Usually only a handful (2 proteins, 2 veggies, 2 carb sides, 2 "desserts") 

Glucose feedback
- CGM twice a year, check which meals spike again, check how quickly i get back to baseline

Alcohol
- Rarely, usually to socialize (~1 drink or less per month)

Poop monitoring
- ~daily or so practice
- use the 1-7 scale
- pay attention to see how it changes with what you eat

Food journaling 
- as-needed to diagnose issues when I'm having gut or energy problems
- usually 1-2 weeks of it. Just drop notes in Notion, none of the apps are fast enough.


### Sleep

Preparing environment (cool, dark, circadian rhythm, clean sheets)
- No A/C, but I aim for a cooler room (under ~70 seems to work well.)
- EightSleep set to ~85-88F.
- Blackout curtains

Consistent schedule
- in bed by 10:30pm most nights, sometimes earlier (especially if I need to feel more refreshed), sometimes later (if I have energy and can afford to burn it)
- Wake by 7am most mornings, 8am the latest. I need at least 8hrs a night to feel refreshed.
- Outside walking twice a day. Once in morning, once in afternoon / before sunset.
- No eating after 6pm for best sleep. I can push it with lighter meals until 7 or 8 if I don’t mind disturbing my sleep
- Avoid: alcohol, heavy meals (high in fat, high in protein, pushing to “full”, heavy in refined sugars/deserts), moderate exercise, and higher stress activities (eg. work, competitive video games, addictive shows) — all of these disturb sleep (can keep me up later, make it more difficult to stay asleep, interrupt REM/deep, keep HRV low + RHR elevated, cause bloating, etc.)

Preparing for bed
- reading (Kindle only)
- Warm shower to cool core body temp
- Breathwork... relaxing 5-5-5.

Catching up on sleep 
- if too many consecutive (2-3)) crap sleep days (< 8hrs), I prioritize 8+ days to get back to baseline.

### Physical fitness

Walking
- Try for 2-3 walks a day, one slower pace, one faster pace
- Aim for 15m+, but even squeezing in a 2m walk outside is healthful
- Silence, meditation, problem solving, music, podcast, etc depending on energy + goal.

Breathing
- Use nasal breathing + avoid mouth breathing, even during exercise.
- Switch to conscious breathing when I want to be more present
- Use different patterns for different activities
    - eg. 5-4-5 in-hold-out for unwinding; holotropic pattern (1s quick in belly, 1s quick in chest, moderate 2s exhale) for deep focus
    - eg. resistance training = inhale to prep, exhale on the effort
    - eg. cardio/endurance = consistent, smooth deep inhale deep exhale, no pause after the inhale

Sun bathing
- as much as I can get (which is usually ~1hr of direct sunlight on skin with a shirt on)
- on nicer days, shirtless in backyard with direct exposure, rotating every ~5m

Personal Training
- I have both virtual and in-person coaches. The combo works exceptionally well, with my virtual coach taking cues from the in-person trainer, and the in-person coach knowing I’m making serious progress + acting on guidance between visits.
- In-person at a PT clinic, my coach is a certified physical therapist (DPT, OCS, FAAOMPT) and helps me understand root cause of injuries, and guides me through movements to recover + strengthen. I see them monthly.
- Future Fit for virtual - paused. They used to handle my programming. My performance coach is a certified PT (DPT, OCS, CSCS) Current focus is bodyweight, lower-weight resistance and mobility injury rehab to prep me for heavier barbell work. We text via app almost daily.

Stretching and Mobility
- first thing when waking, light movement + stretching
- foam roll + dynamic before workout, foam roll + static after workout
- foam roll / lacrosse ball as needed for targeted (eg. occipital FR, scapula/rotator)

Lifting
- Olympic lifts weekly (squats, deadlift, overhead press, bench, snatch)
- dumbbell / kettlebell work for core/trunk

Running
- Paused. Building strength to support knee injuries (ACL replacement, soft tissue damage)
- Instead of running, spending time on longer (~30min) walks
    
Biking
- 2x a week, low impact. Usually a 20-30m ride on Peloton. Or, outside with my kid, more casual, ~1hr or more.

Yoga
- Paused. I enjoy doing it with a class, but don’t feel safe with COVID. Tried virtual yoga (eg. youtube or Peloton) and it was ok, but didn’t feel the same connection to my movement as when I’m present with others. I get stretching/mobility + breathwork elsewhere.

Swimming
- Paused. Waiting for summer pool opening.

Sauna + cold plunge
- I don’t have regular access to a sauna (working on it.) My go-to is a bathhouse with ~170f sauna + ~60f cold plunge that I cycle through. Normally 10-15m sauna, 1m break, 2-3m cold plunge, then let body get back up to temp (~5m) before sauna again. Repeat 2-3x.
- Cold plunge at home, weekly in summer, monthly in winter. Stock tank, 170gal, 4 ice bags from 7-Eleven for $20 gets it down to high 40s F

Cold showers
- At-home, as cold as it gets (~70f), every morning after my normal shower. I go for ~1-2m of rinsing. Sometimes evening, but usually feels best as an energizer in the morning.

Sex
- as often as possible, prioritized monthly (kids timing is toughhhh), try for weekly


### Emotional fitness

- Practice: self-awareness, empathy, mindfulness, curiosity, play, resilience, communication
- Leadership coaching as-needed
- Tarot for self reflection (see Jessica Dore)

### Mindfulness

- Gratitude
    - "everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about" ← build that empathy and kindness.
- Walking and thinking
- Gardening
- Deep focus work
- Being present in as much as you can (relationships, work, self care, etc) — Wait But Why “this could be the last time” calendar

### Stress relief

- video games / hanging with friends almost nightly
- cooking
- working out
- being in nature
- chores around the house (dishes, laundry, picking up + organizing, groceries, meal prep)

### Relationships

- regular meetings to connect
- txt rituals
- (chosen) family focus
    - daily phone calls with mom + pops
- presence — putting away all distractions and being singularly focused on another person when we’re together

### Longevity

- Supplements (see above in Nutrition.)
- Biomarker discipline (tracking biomarkers regularly and adjusting practices as-needed)
- Wearables (Levels yearly check; Apple Watch for movement, paired with Future for workouts; Oura for sleep quality, especially when I start slipping.)
- Resting HRV monitoring as sign of stress (lower HRV = higher stress because of sympathetic nervous system association, see Peter Attia pod.)
- Healthcare team (Parsley, functional med doc, performance coaches, leadership coach, therapy)
