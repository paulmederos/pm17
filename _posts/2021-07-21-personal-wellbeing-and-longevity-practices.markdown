I'm writing this guide for myself, and making it public so it might help others. I'm going to version it as I make changes. I'll cover holistically a wide range of topics.

### Nutrition

**💧 Hydration**
- keep water bottle full, but don’t overdo it

**🥗 Diet**
- Mostly Paleo. Avoid gluten, avoid cow dairy.
    - Breakfast: oatmeal, eggs, bacon, chia pudding, berries
    - lunch: animal or plant protein + veggies, raw or cooked.
    - dinner: plant protein + starchy veggies / rice / grain-free carb alts (eg. almond flour/casava pasta)
- Mini elimination protocols twice a year, ~15-30 days
    - for SIBO control + digestive health
    - for me: strict grain/dairy-free + low FODMAP + no refined sugars (even if “paleo” treats with things like coconut sugar, agave, monk fruit, etc.)
- Meal Hygiene
    - Don't graze between meals. This keeps digestion "on" all the time, and it needs rest to go through it's processes well. At each meal, try to eat all your food within a 30m window, then stay fasted until the next meal. Snacking is ok, but sit and make it a real snack with fasting before/after, and only eating within a small window to avoid drawn out grazing.
    - Don't eat within a few hours of sleeping. Metabolism keeps body awake and impacts sleep negatively.
    - Chew very well — slowly, intentionally when possible. Gives enzymes in mouth chance to break down food more before stomach, leads to better digestion overall.
    - Drink fluids before meal (not during or after) for optimal digestion. More fluids = more dilution of digestive juices
- Fasting, time-restricted
    - Default to 14:10, but shift to 16:8 (or more) when needed
    - Currently no extended fasts or water fasts
- Glucose feedbackk: GM twice a year, check which meals spike again, check how quickly i get back to baseline
- No alcohol; rarely to socialize (~1 drink or less per month), and always wine or sake. No beer, no hard liquor. 
- Poop monitoring
    - ~daily or so practice
    - use the 1-7 scale
    - pay attention to see how it changes with what you eat
- Food journaling 
    - as-needed to diagnose issues when I'm having gut or energy problems
    - usually 1-2 weeks of it. Just drop notes in Notion, none of the apps are fast enough.

**🌿 Supplementation**
- Daily: 
    - 2g/day, DHA Omega-3 (fish oil, viva naturals or omegagenics)
    - Caffeine (1 espresso worth per day; one or two more espresso drinks with decaf for the ritual)
- As-needed: 
    - Adaptogenic herbs (Ashwaghanda > Reishi > Chaga = Cordyceps = Lions Mane)
    - Resveratrol - paused.
    - Homocysteine Supreme (aka B-complex) - paused.
    - SIBO-related supps (eg. DGL powder for mucous membrane support) - paused.

**🍲 Cooking**
- Keep basic ingredients on hand weekly
    - Fruits (berries, bananas, oranges/mandarins, apples, stonefruit, kiwi, lemon/limes)
    - Veggies (onion/shallot, garlic, celery, carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms, leafy greens like spinach/arugula/kale/lettuce)
    - Starches (rices, gluten-free pastas, sometimes GF breads -- no buckweaht, no millet, no sourghum)
    - Meats (salmon/cod fillet or smoked; canned small fishes like anchovies/mackarel/sardines... Patagonia Provisions is tasty; pre-cooked chicken via [Kevin's](https://www.kevinsnaturalfoods.com/); ground beef 80/20 grassfed pasture; heritage pork bacon)
- Weekly Meal prep: sunday after farmers market I try to chop/prep fruits and veggies. Put them in a clear jar (re-using from my meal delivery services) so it's easy to see in fridge and take out for cooking/snacking. 
- Prepared meal delivery: I use Methodology and Territory for meals weekly. Usually only a handful (2 proteins, 2 veggies, 2 carb sides, 2 "desserts")

### Sleep

**🌒 Preparing environment** (cool, dark, circadian rhythm, clean sheets)
- No A/C, but I aim for a cooler room (under ~70 seems to work well.)
- EightSleep set to ~85-88F.
- Blackout curtains

**🌅 Consistent schedule**
- in bed by 10:30pm most nights, sometimes earlier (especially if I need to feel more refreshed), sometimes later (if I have energy and can afford to burn it)
- Wake by 7am most mornings, 8am the latest. I need at least 8hrs a night to feel refreshed.
- Outside walking twice a day. Once in morning, once in afternoon / before sunset.
- No eating after 6pm for best sleep. I can push it with lighter meals until 7 or 8 if I don’t mind disturbing my sleep
- Avoid: alcohol, heavy meals (high in fat, high in protein, pushing to “full”, heavy in refined sugars/deserts), moderate exercise, and higher stress activities (eg. work, competitive video games, addictive shows) — all of these disturb sleep (can keep me up later, make it more difficult to stay asleep, interrupt REM/deep, keep HRV low + RHR elevated, cause bloating, etc.)

**💤 Evening wind-down routine**
- reading (Kindle only)
- Warm shower to cool core body temp
- Breathwork... relaxing 5-5-5.

😴 **Catching up on sleep**
- if too many consecutive (2-3)) crap sleep days (< 8hrs), I prioritize 8+ days to get back to baseline.

### Physical Fitness

🌳 **Walking**
- Try for 2-3 walks a day, one slower pace, one faster pace
- Aim for 15m+, but even squeezing in a 2m walk outside is healthful
- Silence, meditation, problem solving, music, podcast, etc depending on energy + goal.

😤 **Breathing**
- Use nasal breathing + avoid mouth breathing, even during exercise.
- Switch to conscious breathing when I want to be more present
- Use different patterns for different activities
    - eg. 5-4-5 in-hold-out for unwinding; holotropic pattern (1s quick in belly, 1s quick in chest, moderate 2s exhale) for deep focus
    - eg. resistance training = inhale to prep, exhale on the effort
    - eg. cardio/endurance = consistent, smooth deep inhale deep exhale, no pause after the inhale

😎 **Sun bathing**
- as much as I can get (which is usually ~1hr of direct sunlight on skin with a shirt on)
- on nicer days, shirtless in backyard with direct exposure, rotating every ~5m

💪 **Personal training**
- I have both virtual and in-person coaches. The combo works exceptionally well, with my virtual coach taking cues from the in-person trainer, and the in-person coach knowing I’m making serious progress + acting on guidance between visits.
    - **In-person** at a PT clinic, my coach is a certified physical therapist (DPT, OCS, FAAOMPT) and helps me understand root cause of injuries, and guides me through movements to recover + strengthen. I see them monthly.
    - Future Fit for **virtual** - paused. They used to handle my programming. My performance coach is a certified PT (DPT, OCS, CSCS) Current focus is bodyweight, lower-weight resistance and mobility injury rehab to prep me for heavier barbell work. We text via app almost daily.

🤸 **Stretching and Mobility**
- controlled articular rotations and RAILs/PAILs (see [Kinstretch](https://kinstretchwithbeard.vhx.tv/))
- first thing when waking, light movement + stretching
- foam roll / lacrosse ball as needed for targeted (eg. occipital FR, scapula/rotator, sternum)

 🏋️**Lifting**
- Olympic lifts weekly (squats, deadlift, overhead press, bench, snatch)
- dumbbell / kettlebell work for core/trunk
    
🚲 **Biking**
- 2x a week, low impact. Usually a 20-30m ride on Peloton. Or, outside with my kid, more casual, ~1hr or more.

🏊 **Swimming**
- Paused. Waiting for summer pool opening.

🔥❄️ **Thermal hormetic stress (hot/cold therapy)**
- I don’t have regular access to a sauna (working on it.) My go-to is a bathhouse with ~170f sauna + ~60f cold plunge that I cycle through. Normally 10-15m sauna, 1m break, 2-3m cold plunge, then let body get back up to temp (~5m) before sauna again. Repeat 2-3x.
- Cold plunge at home, weekly in summer, monthly in winter. Stock tank, 170gal, 4 ice bags from 7-Eleven for $20 gets it down to high 40s F
- Cold showers few times per week in the morning. At-home, as cold as it gets (~65f), I go for ~1-2m of rinsing. Sometimes evening, but usually feels best as an energizer in the morning.

💋 **Sex**
- as often as possible, prioritized monthly (kids timing is toughhhh), try for weekly

### Emotional Fitness (Mindfulness)

- Practice: self-awareness, empathy, mindfulness, curiosity, play, resilience, communication
- Being present in as much as you can (relationships, work, self care, etc) — Wait But Why “this could be the last time” calendar
- Leadership coaching as-needed
- Deep focus work
- Tarot for self reflection (see [Jessica Dore](https://twitter.com/thejessicadore))
- Gratitude: "everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about" ← build that empathy and kindness.
- Walking and thinking
- Gardening

---

### Stress Relief

- video games / hanging with friends almost nightly
- cooking
- working out
- being in nature
- chores around the house (dishes, laundry, picking up + organizing, groceries, meal prep)

---

### Relationships

- regular meetings to connect
- txt rituals
- (chosen) family focus
    - daily phone calls with mom + pops
- presence — putting away all distractions and being singularly focused on another person when we’re together

---

### Longevity

- Supplements (see above in Nutrition.)
- Biomarker discipline (tracking biomarkers regularly and adjusting practices as-needed)
- Wearables (Levels yearly check; Apple Watch for movement, paired with Future for workouts; Oura for sleep quality, especially when I start slipping.)
- Resting HRV monitoring as sign of stress (lower HRV = higher stress because of sympathetic nervous system association, see Peter Attia pod.)
- Healthcare team (Parsley, functional med doc, performance coaches, leadership coach, therapy)
